Created Xamarin Forms project but didn't get time to consume the services on UI project.

Followed TDD to implement services.

If the time permits, I would have gone ahead and create the ViewModels.

As I am not using any other MVVM frameworks such as PRISM, I would have used DependencyService and inject the dependencies into ViewModels.
